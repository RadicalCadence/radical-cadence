Describing Music in Scala with Domain Specific Languages
========================================================

In my humble experience, there is no easy or scalable way to write and typeset
music on the computer. Professional tools are too expensive and feature-heavy,
open source projects are not user friendly, and neither solution offers
functional abstractions or room for extensions.

This repository is an experiment to create an expressive music tool that fills
the gap that projects like Abjad and Lilypond have left open. Ideally, we aim
to create a Scala library that offers a simple yet powerful DSL to succinctly and
easily write music, which can be parsed by Scala to be manipulated, typeset, and
performed live.
